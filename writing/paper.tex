\section{Data}

We will be analyzing the dataset of National Longitudinal Survey of Youth from 1997. The data set reflects incarceration rates from the year 2002 and the respective gender/race associated with incarceration.
\newpage

\section{Analysis}

In order to provide qualitative analysis over the dataset given, included is three visualizations that depict the data uniquely. Figure 1 portrays the mean number of incarcerations per respective demographic in the year 2002. Figure 2 quantifies the previous visualization, and Figure 3 is a regressed form of the entire dataset.


\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=.85\textwidth]{incarcerations_by_racegender}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Mean Number of Incarcerations in 2002 by Race and Gender}
    \label{fig:graph}
\end{figure}


As displayed above, the largest mean of incarcerations is Black Male with an average of 0.49 (reflected numerically below in Table 1). Non-black/Non-Hispanic females are the higher mean comparative to the men in the respective category with a 0.107 average. Mixed Race (Non-Hispanic) males are non-existent in Figure 1. Table 2 depicts a regression output of the dataset where Hispanic, Mixed Race, and the Non-Black categories are have a negative coefficient. This indicates that there is a negative relationship with the increase in the number of incarcerations and the respective category depicted over 8,978 observations. The Male category, however, shows a positive relationship with incarcerations. This indicates as the amount of incarcerations increase by 0.01, there is a 0.194 increase in the amount of males incarcerated. The r-squared value is very low so this regression does not provide perfect, accurate measures of the regression at hand.
